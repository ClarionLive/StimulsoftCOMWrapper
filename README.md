Copy the Templates and Classes from the "Required" folder to their appropriate places in your Clarion folder.

Take note of the files and folder in the Output folder.  Everything in here needs to be distributed, and the Stimulsoft.Report.Com folder
needs to be distributed as well inside of that folder.  This is so regfree com will work.

Note that the Stimulsoft.Report.Com.manifest file is in the main folder, this needs to be distributed as well with your application.
